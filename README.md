# SleepHelper-Demo

A demonstration project for the new Sleep Helper library

## Goal of this project

The idea of this project is to demonstrate one way to use the new Sleep Helper library in a way that should be easily updateable and maintainable.

Central to this approach is to reduce the amount of customization of the main source file and break out functionality into header files.  If this approach proved useful, it should be easy to customize this code to reflect the specifics of your implementation (sensors, sample times, hours of operations, etc.)

I am looking for feedback and suggestions on whether this approach makes sense or if there is a better way.
